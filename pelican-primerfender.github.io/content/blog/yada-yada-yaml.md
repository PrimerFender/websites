CI/CD, Pipelines, Build, Release, Deploy...so many steps and so many names.
I recently started digging into both AWS' and Azure's public cloud based CI/CD
pipeline offerings and the first thing I noticed is they both rely on 
[YAML](https://yaml.org/) files to define their configuration, with a specifc name
in the root directory of the git repo. YAML is being used everywhere nowadays as a 
human-readabe, declartive file format (compared to XML and JSON anyway).
